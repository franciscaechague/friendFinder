# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

### Overview

I built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app then displayes the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

I used Express to handle routing.
